FURTHER, KOD GEMISI DOES NOT WARRANT RESULTS OF USE OR THAT THE SOFTWARE IS BUG FREE OR ERROR FREE OR THAT ITS USE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT. ALL THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMERS ALSO APPLY IN FULL WITH RESPECT TO KOD GEMISI’S LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, CONTRACTORS AND AGENTS.

	<br>

	<h2>8. Termination.</h2>

Upon termination for any reason, the Agreement granted hereunder shall terminate and You shall immediately discontinue all use of the Software and destroy and remove from all computers, hard drives, networks and other storage media all copies of the Software, but the terms of this Agreement will otherwise remain in effect.
	<br>

	<h2>9. Miscellaneous.</h2>
	No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and You do not have any authority of any kind to bind Kod Gemisi in any respect whatsoever. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that this Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by You except with Kod Gemisi’s prior written consent. Kod Gemisi may transfer, assign or delegate this Agreement and its rights and obligations without consent. You grant Kod Gemisi the right to include Your name, trademark, logo or similar identifying material (“Your Marks”) in a listing of customers on Kod Gemisi’s website and in other promotional material in relation to the Software. Within thirty (30) days of Your written request, Kod Gemisi will remove Your Marks from its website customer list and will make no further use of Your marks in any future material promoting the Software. 
	In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the parties hereto shall consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties through mediation. Unless otherwise agreed between the parties, the mediator will be nominated by Turkish jurisdiction. No party may commence any court proceedings or arbitration proceedings in relation to any dispute arising out of this Agreement until it has attempted to settle the dispute under mediation. If the parties do not reach settlement within a period of 60 days, arbitration proceedings may commence only in Istanbul, Turkey unless mutually agreed between the parties. All negotiations and arbitration proceedings pursuant to this Section will be confidential and treated as compromise and settlement negotiations for purposes of all similar rules and codes of evidence of applicable legislation and jurisdictions. The language of the arbitration shall be Turkish.
	<br>

	<h2>10. Trial Use Rights and Conversion.</h2>
	If the Software is a trial edition, then this Section applies to You. You may only use the trial software for internal evaluation purposes. You may convert your trial rights at any time to the full rights described in the rest of these license terms by purchasing a commercial license and obtaining a product key from Kod Gemisi. Your rights to use the trial Software are limited to 30 days or such other trial period as is authorized by Kod Gemisi in the documentation accompanying the trial Software. After the expiration of the trial period, without conversion, the trial Software will stop running. During the trial period, Section 4 of this Agreement does not apply and Your license pursuant to Section 1 is modified by this Section 10. The remaining sections of this Agreement apply.
	<br>

	<h2>11. Installation Information.</h2>
	When the Software is installed for the first time, the Software may collect certain information from the computer on which it is installed regarding installation of the Software and the host software with which the Software is used (e.g. Jira or Confluence), such as identification of the host software and its license type. Additionally, the Software contains certain user tracking features that enable Kod Gemisi to collect certain information regarding Your Software usage such as language, web browser and product features to help improve the overall usability of the Software. This information is used by Kod Gemisi to evaluate and improve product installations and Kod Gemisi’s products and services. Kod Gemisi may also share it with the vendor of the host software for their use in improving how their products and services. The collected information may be transferred to Kod Gemisi in Turkey or other countries that may have less protective data protection laws than the region in which You are situated (including the European Union).

	<br>

	<h2>12. Changes to this Agreement.</h2>
	Kod Gemisi may update or modify this Agreement from time to time, including any referenced policies and other documents. If a revision meaningfully reduces Your rights, Kod Gemisi will use reasonable efforts to notify You (by, for example, sending an email to the billing or technical contact you designate in the applicable Order, posting on our blog, through your Atlassian account, or in the Product itself). If Kod Gemisi modifies the Agreement during Your License Term or Subscription Term, the modified version will be effective upon Your next renewal of a License Term, Support and Maintenance term, or Subscription Term, as applicable. In this case, if You object to the updated Agreement, as Your exclusive remedy, You may choose not to renew, including cancelling any terms set to auto-renew. With respect to No-Charge Products, accepting the updated Agreement is required for You to continue using the No-Charge Products. You may be required to click through the updated Agreement to show your acceptance. If you do not agree to the updated Agreement after it becomes effective, you will no longer have a right to use No-Charge Products. For the avoidance of doubt, any order is subject to the version of the Agreement in effect at the time of the order.
